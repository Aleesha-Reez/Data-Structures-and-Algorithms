/*Q1
Given the root node of a binary search tree (BST) and a value. You need to find the node in the BST that the node's value equals the given value.
Return the subtree rooted with that node. If such node doesn't exist, you should return NULL.

For example, 

Given the tree:
        4
       / \
      2   7
     / \
    1   3

And the value to search: 2
You should return this subtree:

      2     
     / \   
    1   3
In the example above, if we want to search the value 5, since there is no node with value 5, we should return NULL.

Note that an empty tree is represented by NULL, therefore you would see the expected output (serialized tree format) as [], not null.

/*Q2
Given a binary search tree, rearrange the tree in in-order so that the leftmost node in the tree is now the root of the tree,
and every node has no left child and only 1 right child.

Example 1:
Input: [5,3,6,2,4,null,8,1,null,null,null,7,9]

       5
      / \
    3    6
   / \    \
  2   4    8
 /        / \ 
1        7   9

Output: [1,null,2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6,null,7,null,8,null,9]

Note:

The number of nodes in the given tree will be between 1 and 100.
Each node will have a unique integer value from 0 to 1000.

Invert a binary tree.

Example:

Input:

     4
   /   \

Output:

This problem was inspired by this original tweet by Max Howell:

Google: 90% of our engineers use the software you wrote (Homebrew), but you canâ€™t invert a binary tree on a whiteboard so f*** off.

/*Q4
Given an array where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.

Example:

Given the sorted array: [-10,-3,0,5,9],

One possible answer is: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the following height balanced BST:

      0
     / \
   -3   9
   /   /
 -10  5

Given a Binary Search Tree (BST), convert it to a Greater Tree such that every key of the original BST
is changed to the original key plus sum of all keys greater than the original key in BST.

Example:

Input: The root of a Binary Search Tree like this:
              5
            /   \
           2     13

Output: The root of a Greater Tree like this:

/*Q6
Given an integer array with no duplicates. A maximum tree building on this array is defined as follow:

The root is the maximum number in the array.
The left subtree is the maximum tree constructed from left part subarray divided by the maximum number.
The right subtree is the maximum tree constructed from right part subarray divided by the maximum number.
Construct the maximum tree by the given array and output the root node of this tree.

Example 1:
Input: [3,2,1,6,0,5]
Output: return the tree root node representing the following tree:

Given preorder and inorder traversal of a tree, construct the binary tree.

Given a binary tree and a sum, find all root-to-leaf paths where each path's sum equals the given sum.
